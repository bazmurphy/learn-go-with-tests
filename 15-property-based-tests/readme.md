# Intro to Property Based Tests

## Wrapping up

### More TDD practice with iterative development

Did the thought of writing code that converts 1984 into MCMLXXXIV feel intimidating to you at first?
It did to me and I've been writing software for quite a long time.

The trick, as always, is to **get started with something simple and take small steps**.

At no point in this process did we make any large leaps, do any huge refactorings, or get in a mess.

I can hear someone cynically saying "this is just a kata". I can't argue with that, but I still take this same approach for every project I work on.
I never ship a big distributed system in my first step, I find the simplest thing the team could ship (usually a "Hello world" website) and then iterate on small bits of functionality in manageable chunks, just like how we did here.

The skill is knowing how to split work up, and that comes with practice and with some lovely TDD to help you on your way.

### Property based tests

- Built into the standard library

- If you can think of ways to describe your domain rules in code, they are an excellent tool for giving you more confidence

- Force you to think about your domain deeply

- Potentially a nice complement to your test suite
