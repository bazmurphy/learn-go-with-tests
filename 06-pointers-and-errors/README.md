# Pointers and Errors

## Unchecked Errors

Whilst the Go compiler helps you a lot, sometimes there are things you can still miss and error handling can sometimes be tricky.

There is one scenario we have not tested. To find it, run the following in a terminal to install `errcheck`, one of many linters available for Go.

`go install github.com/kisielk/errcheck@latest`

Then, inside the directory with your code run `errcheck .`

```sh
$ errcheck .
wallet_test.go:17:18:   wallet.Withdraw(Bitcoin(10))
```

What this is telling us is that we have not checked the error being returned on that line of code.

That line of code on corresponds to our normal withdraw scenario because we have not checked that if the Withdraw is successful that an error is not returned.

## Wrapping up

### Pointers

- Go copies values when you pass them to functions/methods, so if you're writing a function that needs to mutate state you'll need it to take a pointer to the thing you want to change.
- The fact that Go takes a copy of values is useful a lot of the time but sometimes you won't want your system to make a copy of something, in which case you need to pass a reference. Examples include referencing very large data structures or things where only one instance is necessary \(like database connection pools\).

### nil

- Pointers can be nil
- When a function returns a pointer to something, you need to make sure you check if it's nil or you might raise a runtime exception - the compiler won't help you here.
- Useful for when you want to describe a value that could be missing

### Errors

- Errors are the way to signify failure when calling a function/method.
- By listening to our tests we concluded that checking for a string in an error would result in a flaky test. So we refactored our implementation to use a meaningful value instead and this resulted in easier to test code and concluded this would be easier for users of our API too.
- This is not the end of the story with error handling, you can do more sophisticated things but this is just an intro. Later sections will cover more strategies.

### Create new types from existing ones

- Useful for adding more domain specific meaning to values
- Can let you implement interfaces

Pointers and errors are a big part of writing Go that you need to get comfortable with. Thankfully the compiler will _usually_ help you out if you do something wrong, just take your time and read the error.
