# JSON Routing Embedding

##Â Wrapping up

We've continued to safely iterate on our program using TDD, making it support new endpoints in a maintainable way with a router and it can now return JSON for our consumers. In the next chapter, we will cover persisting the data and sorting our league.

What we've covered:

- **Routing**. The standard library offers you an easy to use type to do routing. It fully embraces the `http.Handler` interface in that you assign routes to `Handler`s and the router itself is also a `Handler`. It does not have some features you might expect though such as path variables (e.g `/users/{id}`). You can easily parse this information yourself but you might want to consider looking at other routing libraries if it becomes a burden. Most of the popular ones stick to the standard library's philosophy of also implementing `http.Handler`.

- **Type embedding**. We touched a little on this technique but you can [learn more about it from Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#embedding). If there is one thing you should take away from this is that it can be extremely useful but _always thinking about your public API, only expose what's appropriate_.

- **JSON deserializing and serializing**. The standard library makes it very trivial to serialise and deserialise your data. It is also open to configuration and you can customise how these data transformations work if necessary.
